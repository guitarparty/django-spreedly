A python API for the spreedly subscription service.
===================================================

This wrapper is currently not complete, and currently serves more as a backend for [django-paid-subscriptions](https://github.com/chrisdrackett/django-paid-subscriptions).

However the plan is that this should be able to stand alone to use the spreedly service with any python project.

Todo:
=====

* add support for sending a user to spreedly to sign up for a subscription
* add support for checking if a subscription for a user has been activated

Please raise all issues with this project at our [lighthouse](http://chrisdrackett.lighthouseapp.com/projects/39822-python-django-spreedly) page.
